= Delete an Object Storage Bucket

If you do not need an Object Storage bucket, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete objectbucket my-bucket
----

IMPORTANT: If you delete the `ObjectBucket` object from the cluster, it will delete the actual bucket as well!
There will be a `DeletionPolicy` soon, that will provide accidental deletion protection.
