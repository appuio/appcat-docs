= How to Use an AppCat Object Bucket

Object Buckets are S3 compatible.

Maybe with some example?

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: ObjectBucket
metadata:
  name: my-cool-bucket
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  parameters:
    bucketName: my-bucket-change-name
    region: rma
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: objectbucket-creds
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: s3-consumer
  labels:
    app: s3-consumer
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: s3-consumer
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: s3-consumer
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: s3-consumer
        image: s3-consumer:latest
        envFrom: <1>
          - secretRef:
              name: objectbucket-creds
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

<1> This example assumes that the fields in the secret correspond to the environment variables that the app expects.
    Depending on your application, you may need to map fields from the secret to an environment variable.

(maybe we should add an example where we map the fields explicitly?)
