.Example to create an Object Storage bucket
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: ObjectBucket
metadata:
  name: my-cool-bucket
  namespace: my-namespace <1>
spec:
  parameters:
    bucketName: my-bucket-change-name <2>
    region: rma <3>
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: objectbucket-creds <4>
----
<1> The namespace where the object will be created.
<2> Bucket name: *don't just copy/paste this code, remember to choose your own name here!*
<3> The bucket's region depends on the selected Provider, see TODO: for more details
<4> Secret where the connection details are provisioned. This secret shouldn't exist at this time.
+
IMPORTANT: Object Storage Bucket names must be unique across providers. Make sure to choose a name with prefixes and other guards, to prevent any issue during the creation of the bucket. No error message is returned if the bucket cannot be created.

. Get information about your new bucket object.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get objectbucket
NAME               READY   CONNECTION-SECRET    AGE
my-cool-bucket     True    objectbucket-creds   5s
----
+
If you see the "True" value in the READY column, it means that your bucket is provisioned and ready to use.
+
IMPORTANT: If your object bucket doesn't get the state ready after a while, try to delete the bucket and re-create it with a different name.

. Get the required secrets to use your bucket from other applications.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get secrets objectbucket-creds -oyaml
----
The complete specification of the generated secret object can be found in the xref:object-storage/secrets.adoc[secrets page].

. Check the bucket status
