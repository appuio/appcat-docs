= Delete an OpenSearch instance

If you do not need an OpenSearch instance anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete exoscaleopensearches.exoscale.appcat.vshn.io opensearch-instance
----

IMPORTANT: If you delete the `ExoscaleOpenSearch` object from the cluster, it will delete the actual instance including all data in it!
