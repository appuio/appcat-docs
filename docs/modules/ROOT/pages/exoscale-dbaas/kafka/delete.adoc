= Delete a Kafka instance

If you do not need a Kafka instance anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete exoscalekafka my-kafka-example
----

IMPORTANT: If you delete the `ExoscaleKafka` object from the cluster, it will delete the actual Kafka including all data in it!
